# odin-recipes

## I made a simple recipe website using only html.
I have added heading, sub-headings, images, links to recipes, and the steps to make each recipe on each page.
`<h1>` for the main heading, `<h2>` for headings for different recipes.
`<p>` for writing a brief introduction to the recipe. and then I used `<img>` tag for images, with `<a>`â€”anchor tag to link different webpages containing different recipes.
